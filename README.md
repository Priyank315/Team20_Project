## Participant Expectations

* Participants are expected to attend live learning sessions and the case study as part of the learning experience. Participants are expected to use the rest of the scheduled work period time to complete their projects.
* Participants are encouraged to ask questions and collaborate with others to enhance learning.
* Participants must have a computer and an internet connection to participate in online activities.
* Participants must not use generative AI such as ChatGPT to generate code. It should be used as a supportive tool to seek out answers to questions you may have.
* We expect participants to have completed the [onboarding repo](https://github.com/UofT-DSI/onboarding/tree/main/onboarding_documents).
* We encourage participants to default to having their camera on at all times, and turning the camera off only as needed. This will greatly enhance the learning experience for all participants and provides real-time feedback for the instructional team.

### Delivery of Team Project Modules

Each Team Project module will include one or two live learning sessions and one case study presentation. During live learning sessions, facilitators will introduce the project, walk through relevant examples, and introduce various team skills that support project success. The remaining time will be used for teams to assemble and work on their projects, as well as get help from the facilitator or the learning support to troubleshoot any issues a team may be encountering. 

Work periods will also be used as opportunities for teams to collaborate and work together, while accessing learning support.
